The Eye of Cthulhu is a [pre-Hardmode] [boss]. It is one of the first bosses a player may encounter, as it spawns automatically when a relatively early level of game advancement is achieved. It can also be summoned manually with the [Suspicious Looking Eye] at night (see [#Spawn] below).

This is some other text.

# Spawn
The Eye of Cthulu can be summoned manually using a [Suspicious Looking Eye] at [night] (beginning at 7:30 PM in-game time). It also has a 1/3 chance of spawning automatically each night, if the following conditions apply:

- The Eye of Cthulu has not yet been defeated in the current world
- At least one player in the world has at least 200 maximum [health] and more than 10 [defense].
- At least four [town NPCs|Town NPC] (including the [Travelling Merchant] and [town pets]) are present in the world.

# Behaviour
The Eye of Cthulhu has two phases, and is able to fly through blocks in both of them. During the first, it attempts to float directly above the player, while spawning 3-4 [Servants of Cthulhu|Servants of Cthulhu], which drop [Hearts|Heart] and [Stars|Star] on death.

this shouldn't become a section because it's at a depth of 5 when its parent is only 3

- 15 defense (using [Iron Armor] or [Tungsten Armor])
- [Iron Broadsword]
